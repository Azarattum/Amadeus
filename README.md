# Amadeus

This is a rewrite of [AmadeusCore](https://github.com/Azarattum/AmadeusCore) and [AmadeusUI](https://github.com/Azarattum/AmadeusUI) in one monorepo. Currently it is heavy work in progress (not in a usable state yet). If you are looking for LibFun, check it [here](https://github.com/Azarattum/Amadeus/tree/main/packages/libfun).
